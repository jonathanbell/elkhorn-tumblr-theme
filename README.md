Elkhorn Tumblr Theme
====================

This is a purpose driven theme.

This theme aims to provide photographers or artists with a visually impacting blog or website. **IT ONLY SUPPORTS PHOTO POST TYPES.** All other post types such as: Text, Photoset, Audio, Chat, and Video will not be displayed on your blog but will still be viewable in your followers' Dashboards. However, on your actual blog (ex: yourblog.tumblr.com) only photos will be displayed.

## And displayed they shall be!

Elkhorn displays photos FULL SCREEN. I suggest just installing this theme to see if you like it. :)

## To Install this Theme

1. [Click this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonathanbell/elkhorn-tumblr-theme/master/elkhorn.html) and copy _all_ of Elkhorn's source code.

3. Now in the customize area of your blog, click "Edit HTML" and delete **ALL** of the existing code.
